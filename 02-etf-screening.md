ETF screening is the process of filtering through thousands of available ETFs to find those that align with your investment strategy. You'll learn to:

- Define screening criteria based on investment objectives

- Create custom screening workflows

## Screening Criteria

- Geographic exposure (domestic, international, emerging markets)

- Investment style (growth, value, blend)

### Quality Metrics
- Expense ratio thresholds
- Assets under management (AUM) minimums
- Average daily trading volume
- Bid-ask spread analysis
- Tracking error relative to benchmark

### Performance Filters
- Historical returns over various time periods
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- Maximum drawdown analysis
- Correlation with existing holdings
