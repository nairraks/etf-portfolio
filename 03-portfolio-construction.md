# Portfolio Construction

This chapter covers the methodologies and techniques for building optimized ETF portfolios based on your investment objectives and constraints.

## Overview

Portfolio construction is where theory meets practice. You'll learn to:

- Define investment objectives and constraints
- Implement modern portfolio theory concepts
- Apply optimization techniques for asset allocation
- Consider transaction costs and practical constraints
- Build portfolios for different risk profiles

## Portfolio Construction Approaches

### Strategic Asset Allocation
- Long-term target allocations
- Risk-based allocation methods
- Factor-based portfolio construction
- Equal-weight vs. market-cap weighted approaches

### Optimization Techniques
- Mean-variance optimization
- Risk parity approaches
- Black-Litterman model implementation
- Robust optimization methods

### Practical Considerations
- Minimum position sizes
- Transaction cost analysis
- Tax efficiency considerations
- Liquidity constraints

## Python Implementation

```python
# Code examples will be added here
# This section is ready for Python code implementation
```

## Risk Management

### Portfolio Risk Metrics
- Portfolio volatility and VaR
- Maximum drawdown analysis
- Stress testing scenarios
- Correlation analysis

### Diversification Strategies
- Geographic diversification
- Sector and style diversification
- Factor diversification
- Alternative asset inclusion

## Implementation Framework

1. Define investment policy statement
2. Set strategic asset allocation targets
3. Select specific ETFs for each allocation
4. Optimize portfolio weights
5. Implement with consideration for costs

## Portfolio Types

- Conservative income-focused portfolios
- Balanced growth and income portfolios
- Aggressive growth portfolios
- Tactical allocation strategies

## Next Steps

Once your portfolio is constructed, you'll need to monitor its performance, which is covered in the next chapter.
