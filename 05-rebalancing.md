# Rebalancing

This chapter covers the systematic approach to maintaining your target portfolio allocation through strategic rebalancing.

## Overview

Rebalancing is essential for maintaining your desired risk profile and ensuring your portfolio stays aligned with your investment objectives. You'll learn to:

- Determine optimal rebalancing frequency
- Set rebalancing triggers and thresholds
- Minimize transaction costs during rebalancing
- Consider tax implications of rebalancing
- Implement systematic rebalancing strategies

## Rebalancing Strategies

### Time-Based Rebalancing
- Calendar rebalancing (monthly, quarterly, annually)
- Pros and cons of different frequencies
- Market timing considerations
- Seasonal effects and patterns

### Threshold-Based Rebalancing
- Percentage deviation triggers
- Absolute dollar amount thresholds
- Volatility-adjusted thresholds
- Multi-tier threshold systems

### Hybrid Approaches
- Combining time and threshold methods
- Conditional rebalancing strategies
- Market condition-based adjustments

## Python Implementation

## Cost Considerations

### Transaction Costs
- Bid-ask spread impact
- Commission and fee analysis
- Market impact costs
- Opportunity cost of cash

### Tax Efficiency
- Tax-loss harvesting opportunities
- Wash sale rule considerations
- Asset location optimization
- Tax-deferred vs. taxable accounts

## Rebalancing Process

### Pre-Rebalancing Analysis
- Current vs. target allocation review
- Deviation measurement
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Market condition assessment

### Execution Strategy
- Order sizing and timing
- Partial vs. full rebalancing
- Cash flow integration
- Trade execution optimization

### Post-Rebalancing Review
- Execution quality analysis
- Cost tracking and reporting
- Performance impact assessment
- Process improvement identification

## Advanced Rebalancing Techniques

### Dynamic Rebalancing
- Volatility-based adjustments
- Momentum and mean reversion considerations
- Market regime-dependent strategies

### Multi-Asset Rebalancing
- Cross-asset class considerations
- Currency hedging decisions
- Alternative investment integration

## Rebalancing Framework

1. Monitor portfolio drift
2. Evaluate rebalancing triggers
3. Analyze costs and benefits
4. Execute rebalancing trades
5. Document and review results

## Common Rebalancing Challenges

- Over-rebalancing and transaction costs
- Under-rebalancing and drift risk
- Market timing temptations
- Behavioral biases in rebalancing

## Conclusion

Effective rebalancing is crucial for long-term portfolio success. By implementing a systematic approach, you can maintain your target allocation while minimizing costs and maximizing after-tax returns.

## Portfolio Management Cycle

This completes the full portfolio management cycle:
1. Data Collection → 2. ETF Screening → 3. Portfolio Construction → 4. Performance Tracking → 5. Rebalancing

The cycle then repeats, with performance insights informing future screening and construction decisions.
