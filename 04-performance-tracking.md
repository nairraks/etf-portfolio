This chapter focuses on monitoring and analyzing your ETF portfolio's performance to ensure it meets your investment objectives.

## Overview

Effective performance tracking helps you understand how your portfolio is performing and identify areas for improvement. You'll learn to:

- Create performance dashboards and reports
- Identify performance drivers and detractors

## Performance Metrics

- Money-weighted returns (IRR)
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar ratios)
- Rolling performance analysis

### Risk Metrics

- Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR
- Maximum drawdown and recovery periods
- Beta and correlation analysis

### Benchmark Comparison
- Relative performance vs. benchmarks
- Tracking error analysis
- Information ratio calculation
- Up/down market capture ratios

## Python Implementation

```python
# Code examples will be added here
